\section{Doctrine estopple do not apply} {
  Minors are not bound by the rule of estopple. A minor can always plead thier minority, even if they have been falseley represented as a major. They can't be sued or entort.
 }

\section{Contracts by Parent/Guardian/Manager ( as a representative)} {
  \begin{enumerate}
	  \item A minor's P/G/M can enter into contract on behalf of the minor, provided that the P/G/M acts within the scope of their authority (Not convicted, Mentally sound etc.)
	  \item The contract should be in the beinfit of the minor
	  \item The P/G/M cannot purchase immovable property on behalf of the minor
	  \item But a Guardian, certified by the court, can sell the minors immovable property for the minor's benifit with the court's sanction
  \end{enumerate}
 }

\section{Liability of a minor's parents} {
  \begin{enumerate}
	  \item The parents of a minor are not liable for the agreement made by their minor ward, However they can be held accountable if the minor makes the agreement as their authorized agent.
	  \item Only capable people can be appointed as an agent for a contract, and since a minor person is incapable for this, they cannot be appointed as an agent.
  \end{enumerate}
 }

\section{Minor Partners} {
  Partnership arises out of a contract and since a minor is incapable of enterins into a contract, they cannot become a partner. However, a minor can be admitted to the benifits of a existing clause with the consent of the partners, thus they can be a partner in profit of the firm, but not a partner of the firm itself.
 }

\section {Guarantees \textit{FOR} and \textit{BY} the minors} {
  A contract of Guarantee in favour of the minor is valid, however, a minor cannot be a guranter in a Contract of Guarantee, because minors can never be held personally accountable
 }
